# sum
A custom module built for Drupal 8 used to add two numbers together, and display them on the screen.

To use:
Add a folder called "sum" to your Drupal 8 directory in the 'modules' folder. (Drupal-8/modules/sum)
If you are also using contrib modules, you might prefer to nest the files like this: Drupal-8/modules/Custom/sum.
